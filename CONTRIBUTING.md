### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing? You can start by looking through these `beginner` and `help-wanted` issues:

- [Beginner issues](https://github.com/techdebtgpt/maintsight/labels/beginner) - issues which should only require a few lines of code
- [Help wanted issues](https://github.com/techdebtgpt/maintsight/labels/help%20wanted) - issues which should be a bit more involved than `beginner` issues

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code lints
6. Issue that pull request!

## Development Process

### Setup

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/your-username/maintsight-cli.git
cd maintsight-cli

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the project
npm run build

# Run tests
npm test
```

### Development Workflow

1. Create a feature branch:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Make your changes and test:

   ```bash
   npm run test:watch
   npm run lint
   ```

3. Build and test the CLI:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run cli:dev predict ./test-repo
   ```

4. Commit your changes:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add amazing feature"
   ```

### Commit Message Guidelines

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

- `feat:` - A new feature
- `fix:` - A bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation only changes
- `style:` - Changes that don't affect the code meaning (formatting)
- `refactor:` - Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf:` - Performance improvements
- `test:` - Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore:` - Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

### Code Style

- We use TypeScript in strict mode
- Follow the existing code style (enforced by ESLint)
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused

### Testing

- Write unit tests for all new functionality
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR
- Aim for high test coverage (80%+ for services)
- Use descriptive test names

```typescript
// Good
describe('GitCommitCollector', () => {
  it('should fetch commits from specified branch', () => {
    // test implementation
  });
});

// Bad
describe('test', () => {
  it('works', () => {
    // test implementation
  });
});
```

### Documentation

- Update README.md if you change functionality
- Add JSDoc comments to public APIs
- Update type definitions as needed
- Include examples for new features

## Release Process

1. Update version in `package.json`
2. Update CHANGELOG.md
3. Create a PR with version bump
4. After merge, create a GitHub release
5. Package will be automatically published to npm

## Available Scripts

- `npm run build` - Build the TypeScript project
- `npm run test` - Run the test suite
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm run lint:fix` - Fix ESLint issues automatically
- `npm run cli:dev` - Run the CLI in development mode
